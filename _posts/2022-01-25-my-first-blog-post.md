**Red River Gorge** is closer to 1 hour and a half away but it is my FAV! There is so much to do!! 
1. Natural Bridge is the typical trail people do there and is easy to find via google and has its own parking lot since it is the main tourist attraction but it is so fun and beautiful! 
2. Indian staircase is the trail I took your sister in at the gorge that is a little harder physically but so worth it and all of my roomies were about to do it at some point or another so it isn’t that hard! You can look up the name and get exact written directions on how to get there but you can’t type it into maps or you can tell me when you are going and I can try to type them out for you :) 
3. Jump rock: not a trail but a fun swimming and jumping spot for friends, you can also google this to find where to park and go
4. Kayaking: there are multiple companies at the gorge that you can rent kayaks from and kayak to jump rock or just around the river which is always a fun day!
